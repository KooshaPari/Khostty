"""Symbolic constants for the libghostty-vt C enums.

Every value here was taken from the library's own type manifest (the JSON
returned by ``ghostty_type_json()``), not transcribed by hand from the headers.
:func:`khostty_vt.validate_enum_values` re-derives them from the linked library
at runtime, so a value that drifts in a future version is reported instead of
silently selecting the wrong field.

Members are ``IntEnum``, so they can be passed straight to the C API and also
compared against plain integers.
